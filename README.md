Hey there!
This is my personal repository where Iâ€™m learning and practicing **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** using **C++**.
Iâ€™m a Computer Science student (UBIT'27), and this repo helps me build my logic, solve problems, and write cleaner code over time.



ðŸš€ Whatâ€™s Inside

Iâ€™ve organized the codes by topic so it's easy to find and revise:

* `linked_list/` â€“ singly, circular and doubly linked lists with operations
* `stack/` â€“ implemented using linked lists
* `queue/` â€“ priority queues
* `Trees/` - binary search tree, expression tree
* `heap/` â€“ max heap, heapify from scratch
* `hash_table/` â€“ linear probing, handling collisions
* `graphs/` â€“ adjacency matrix/list, BFS, DFS



ðŸŽ¯ Why I'm doing this

* To improve my DSA and logic-building skills
* To create a clean, beginner-friendly resource (for myself and others)
* To have something solid to look back on during interviews or revisions



ðŸ“Œ Notes

* Iâ€™m writing most of this from scratch without STL, just to learn better
* I try to keep my code neat and comment everything properly
* Feel free to fork or use anything for your own learning!
